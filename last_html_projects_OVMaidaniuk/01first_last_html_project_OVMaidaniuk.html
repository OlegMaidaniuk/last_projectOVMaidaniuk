<p><b>The Simpson family</b> <i>consists of fictional characters featured</i> in the animated television series The
  Simpsons. The
  Simpsons are a nuclear family consisting of married couple Homer and Marge and their three children, Bart, Lisa, and
  Maggie. They live at 742 Evergreen Terrace in the fictional town of Springfield, United States, and they were created
  by cartoonist Matt Groening, who conceived the characters after his own family members, substituting "Bart" for his
  own name. The family debuted on Fox on April 19, 1987, in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" and were later
  spun off into their own series, which debuted on Fox in the U.S. on December 17, 1989.

  Alongside the five main family members, there are a number of other major and minor characters in their family. The
  most commonly recurring characters are Homer's father Abraham "Grampa" Simpson; Marge's sisters Patty and Selma
  Bouvier; and the family's two pets, Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II. Other family members include Homer's mother
  Mona Simpson, Homer's half-brother Herbert Powell, Marge's mother Jacqueline Bouvier, and other minor relatives.</p>

  <li> Yes, honey… Just squeeze your rage up into a bitter little ball and release it at an appropriate time, like
    that day I hit the referee with the whiskey bottle.
  </li>
  <li>No, actually a woman is more like a beer. They smell good; they look good, you’d step over your own mother just
    to get one.
  </li>
  <li>To alcohol! The cause of, and solution to, all of life’s problems.</li>
